	UNIX / LINUX / MACOS X / CYGWIN / MINGW INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. DEPENDENCIES

The complete installation needs:

  a. required:

   - a C++ compiler.

  b. recommended:

   - Qt version >= 4.0.0 for visualization operation (www.trolltech.com).

   - or X11 and Motif for visualization operators.
     However, Qt is preferred to X11.

     Without these two API, operators 'pvisu' and 'pdraw' are not available.
     However, the rest of the operators work without Qt (or X11).

2. UNPACK THE DISTRIBUTIION

  a. Copy the file pandore6.x.x-unix.tgz into the target folder
     (eg. /usr/local/pantheon).

  b. Unpack and untar the file

     gunzip pandore6.x.x-unix.tgz
     tar xvf pandore6.x.x-unix.tar

     or directly

     tar xvfz pandore6.x.x-unix.tgz (or gtar xvfz pandore6.x.x-unix.tgz)


3. INSTALLATION

  Use:

    ./configure
    make (or make -j6)
    make install
    make clean

  The complete installation should create the followings:
  - the library 'libpandore.so' (or libpandore.dylib under MacOS X) in the folder './lib',
  - executable operators in the folder './bin',
  - the launch script './pandore'.

  To check the installation, execute the following commands:

    pandore
    pversion

  or a more complete commands sequence:

    pbmp2pan examples/tangram.bmp /tmp/tangram.pan
    pstatus
    pvisu /tmp/tangram.pan

  The command 'pstatus' must display "SUCCESS".

4. ADVANCED INSTALLATION

    a- Pandore configure script accepts most of the standard Autoconf arguments:

  --help                 	display a help message and exit

  --static			create the static version of the Pandore library
				 	(PREFIX/lib/libpandore.a)

  --with-qmake=PATH		path to the qmake command.

  --with-x11-includes=PATH	path to X11 includes (Motif version only).

  --with-x11-libraries=PATH	path to X11 libraries (Motif version only).

  --with-motif-includes=PATH	path to Motif includes (Motif version only).

  --with-motif-libraries=PATH	path to Motif libraries (Motif version only).

  b- The configure variables you should be aware of are (file 'configure'):

   * PERL	path to the perl interpreter (optional)

   * MAKE	path to the make command;

   * CXX	path to the c++ compiler.

   * CFLAGS	C compiler options.

   * X11INCLUDEPATH: path to the X11 includes.

   * X11LIBPATH: path to the X11 libraries.

   * MOTIFLIBPATH: path to the Motif includes.

   * MOTIFINCLUDEPATH: path to the Motif libraries.

5. COMPLETE REINSTALLATION

  Remove all files from the system which are (or would be) installed by
  'make install' using the current configuration.

      make distclean
